# Overview of the UFO Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a dashboard to visually present the data collected in the samples.json file. The data in this project came from research conducted on the different bacteria found in belly buttons. In order to find the ideal bacterial species to synthezise proteins that taste like beef, bacterial samples were collected from a number of research participants. These research participants are identified by a numerical ID. For each ID, information on the top 10 bacteria, the sample values per bacteria and the washing frequency per week of each participant is visualized in three different charts available on the dashboard. A dropdown menu allows users to choose any ID on the list to view of how these charts change.
